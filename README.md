**Business Challenge: A Solution for Climate Resilience for Eoliann**

📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a business challenge for Eoliann, a climate-tech startup focused on predictive modeling of climate risks. Our team analyzed flood hazards in Italy (2023–2024) and Germany (2024) to support Eoliann’s mission of improving climate resilience for infrastructure and communities.

Flooding is among the most frequent and costly climate threats, causing extensive damage to critical infrastructure, economic disruption, and long-term social impacts. By combining data-driven analysis, geospatial mapping, and resilience modeling, this study highlights vulnerabilities and proposes strategies for risk reduction and investment prioritization
.

🔎 Research Scope

The analysis focused on:

Comparing flood impacts between Italy and Germany.

Identifying sectoral vulnerabilities across four domains:

Agriculture & Natural Resources

Energy, Utilities & Industry

Real Estate & Urban Development

Transportation & Mobility

Exploring physical and socio-economic drivers of flood damage.

Estimating Willingness to Pay (WTP) for resilience investments using land valuation and insurance market data
.

🛠️ Methodology
Tools & Data

Python Notebooks (Flood_Analysis_Italy_Germany_2023_2024.ipynb, maps.ipynb) for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

Geospatial Shapefiles (shp.zip) to map flood hazards.

Flood Dataset (flood.csv) combining hazard, land-use, and infrastructure exposure data.

Analytical Approach

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Integrated multi-source flood and infrastructure data.

Sectoral Impact Analysis: Quantified land area and assets affected.

Damage Classification: Mapped severity across infrastructure types.

Socio-Economic Assessment: Analyzed resilience factors (income, insurance, policy).

Economic Risk Modeling: Used land valuation and sectoral repair costs to approximate WTP.

📊 Key Findings

Italy vs. Germany:

Italy experienced greater infrastructure damage due to weaker urban planning, higher exposure, and resilience disparities.

Germany’s damages were less severe, but transportation & energy sectors were highly vulnerable
.

Sectoral Vulnerability:

Italy: Transportation & Mobility most affected, followed by Real Estate and Energy.

Germany: Agriculture and Transportation bore the largest impact.

Physical Drivers:

Post-2000 infrastructure performed better due to stronger designs (elevated, reinforced).

Older, low-lying, and unprotected assets faced greater destruction.

Socio-Economic Factors:

Well-insured/high-value assets recovered faster.

Underinsured agricultural land and small businesses faced long-term losses.

Willingness to Pay:

Germany: Flood insurance premiums in high-risk areas rose 15%, signaling higher WTP.

Italy: Lower WTP observed in agricultural land (e.g., Po Valley vineyards), but prevention costs far exceed land value
.

💡 Recommendations

Develop infrastructure-specific resilience scores for better prioritization.

Integrate historical flood data with predictive models for stronger risk forecasting.

Create an Economic Risk Indicator (WTP) for insurers, governments, and businesses.

Support policy interventions and investment planning in high-risk sectors (transport, energy, agriculture).

Promote public–private partnerships to balance insurance gaps and improve adaptation financing

🚀 Key Takeaways

Flooding poses an urgent climate resilience challenge for Europe, especially in Italy’s transport sector and Germany’s agricultural/energy sectors.

A data-driven predictive model, combined with economic indicators like WTP, can help Eoliann position itself as a leading climate risk intelligence provider.

The project demonstrates how climate-tech startups can leverage analytics to enable proactive risk management, policy design, and sustainable investment.
